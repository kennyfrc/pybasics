## TODO on Web.py

Learning project for python

* Set application to assign code based on urls (route)
* Set classes that determine what to do with the request (GET, POST)
* As needed, initialize some forms / values
* Interact with Model (DB) to do CRUD actions (and set DB there)
* After doing the DB action, render the view
